-------------------

- Add XSL Transformation function
- Add separators in plugin menu
- Add XML header recognition function
- Fix memory leaks in XPath Expression Evaluation function
- Upgrade from libXML 2.6.30 to libXML 2.6.32+

Release 2.1.1 (r548):
---------------------

- Minor improvement of DTD/XSL validation message report

Release 2.1 (r545):
-------------------

- Make XPath Expression Evaluation input field multiline
- Change XPath Expression Evaluation window to resizable toolbox and make it allow user to access to editor while open
- Change destination path for  libXML DLL's  installed by plugin auto-installer. DLL's are now installed in Windows\System32 directory.

- Add "Linarize XML" function
- Add XML Schema + DTD validation

Release 2.0 (r513):
-------------------

- Replaces eXpat parser with libXML2 parser; new parser offers tons of new features which will be adapted to plugin in future releases. It also supports more encodings.
- Adaptation of all functions of previous version to new libXML parser.
- Add shortcut CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+B to "Pretty Print w/ line breaks" function.
- Add new function "Evaluate XPath expression"
- Fix the non-modal error messages; error messages are now in modal mode so they always appear in foreground.

- Add XML Tools plugin installer; this tool copies the plugin into Notepad++ plugins directory and external libXML DLL's in Notepad++ root directory. External DLL's are required by the new plugin version since it is based on libXML.

Release 1.1.3 (r236):
---------------------

- Slightly change behaviour of new PrettyPrint function. The new version adds carriage returns between tags separated by only spaces and/or tabulations. This means that following code:
    <data> <test/> </data>
  will be formated as:
    <data>
      <test/>
    </data>
  Moreover, empty tags like "<data></data>" or tags which onlycontains spaces and/or tabulations will be auto-closed. For instance:
    <data> </data>
  will be replaced by:
    <data/>
- Modifiy the carriage return sequence: using "\r\n" instead of "\n"
- Fixes formating problem inside comments and CDATA blocks
- Fixes formating problem produced by '>' char (ex: "<data>test></data>" where "test>" is simple text)
- Fixes indentation errors with character '"' placed in text
- Fixes indentation errors with character '>' placed in CDATA
- Fixes encoding problems with tags using special chars (for ex. german umlauts) - Thanks to Christoph Wagner for this report
- Adds conversion of '&' to '&amp;' and reverse in XML <-> text conversion functions 
- Adds conversion of '"' to '&quot;' and reverse in XML <-> text conversion functions
- Fixes the missing copy to clipboard when getting XML path from a tag element (getting from text position was already working)
- Disable "Pretty print", "XML <-> Text" and "Comment/Uncomment" functions when file is read only
- Fixes the scrolling effet which occured after "Pretty print", "XML <-> Text" and "Comment/Uncomment" functions
- Fixes the uncollapse effect which occured after "XML <-> Text" and "Comment/Uncomment" functions
- Improvement of performances + memory usage for "XML <-> Text" and "Comment/Uncomment" functions

Note: Thanks to Thomas Weller for his bug reports and help in beta testing.

Release 1.1.2 (r143):
---------------------

- Fix the misplacement error for check mark of "Tag auto-close" menu entry (the mark appeared on wrong line).

Release 1.1.1 (r124):
---------------------

- Fix the crash bug which occured when using comment/uncomment function on XML code containing CDATA content, or other tags using <![....]> syntax.
 Warning: The new syntax for internal comments (comments inside comments) uses "<!{x}**" and "**{x}>" codes (without quotes) as markers. Since this is not same syntaxe as in previous release, you will not be able to comment/uncomment code using previous syntax. Please be careful with this feature if you used it before. Sorry for inconvenience :(
- Fix the indentation error for XML code with CDATA content, or other tags using <![....]> syntax.
- Add a new command to perform manual XML syntax check.
- XML syntax checker is now based on expat 2.0 instead of 1.95.8
